SkyWalker 4.4.x Kernel Source
====================================

Getting Started
---------------
You can use this source if u Want , 
There is has 2 Variant , HMP and EAS .

Clone with `--recursive` option coz this source has submodule.

Just Copy, Paste, Then Execute the command :)

Make sure `androidboot.version` has defined on Boot Cmdline with
ur Android Version due of this commit:
https://github.com/RyuujiX/android_kernel_asus_sdm660/commit/b6f50a7917e4336495f6b2642064f90d9babed7d

`androidboot.version` default value is `12`

OverClock Kernel
------------------
This Kernel is using Stock Freq. If u want Overclocked Freq, Do this:

To Overclock CPU:

- Add `overclock.cpu=1` into boot cmdline.

To Overclock GPU:

- Add `overclock.gpu=1` into boot cmdline.

KernelSU
--------
KernelSU is implemented and enabled by default. If u don't want it...
Just set `CONFIG_KSU=n` in defconfig or Add `kernelsu.enabled=0` into boot cmdline.

About NLV & LV
--------------
It was LV by default and Enabled only for A11+. If u want to disable it,
Define "0" at `led.vibration` on boot cmdline.

For Android 10 and 9 will set `led.vibration` to "0" / NLV as default

Using R / CAF 9.2 WiFi Drivers
--------------------------------
Now, This Kernel is using Pie / CAF 7.2 WiFi drivers , So if u want to use
R WiFi Driver , Just merge this into kernel source:

https://github.com/RyuujiX/NFI_SkyWalker

Still Recommended to use Pie WiFi Drivers coz it's more optimal :)

Compile for Android Pie
-----------------------

For X00TD, Just Use Pie WiFi Driver.

For X01BD, do this also after Using Pie WiFi Driver:

On Branch r7/hmp and r7/eas:
```bash
   git revert be578e2def2d7a67d6643335d016008f7bee8da8 -n && \
   git revert 5c27bb6d8547112a8b815742c5dbcaae520b4497 -n && \
   git commit -m "Fix WiFi for Android 9"
```

EAS Perf HAL
------------
Usually, X00TD and X01BD Device Trees is using HMP Perf HAL as default.

So, if u want to build ROM with Prebuilt EAS Kernel, Pick this EAS Perf HAL:

https://github.com/RyuujiX/AnyKernel3/tree/4.4-eas/tools/SDM660PerfHAL

Spectrum Support
----------------
Pick Spectrum Script from Here: https://github.com/RyuujiX/spectrum , then rename it to init.spectrum.rc

HMP : ryuu

EAS : eas

Or , make it by ur self .
